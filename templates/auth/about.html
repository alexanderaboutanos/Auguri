    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to a revolutionary birthday application! Once a user has
      sucessfully signed up for an account, they will be directed to the
      <b>main page</b>, which shows a list of their friends and the number of
      days until their birthday. Users are encouraged to add new friends.
    </p>
    <h2>Sending Personal Greetings</h2>
    <p>
      This incredible application possesses the powerful capability of emailing
      you and your friends. Here, there is a variety of different options...
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>[Option 1]</b> You may want to construct pre-written personal messages for each of
      your friends. If you write a personal message, that message will be sent to
      your friend at exactly midnight on the day of their birthday. Your friend will surely feel cared for! 
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[Option 2]</b> You may choose not to write any personal birthday greetings through Auguri.
      In this case, Auguri will not email your friends on their birthday.
      Instead, Auguri will email <i>you</i> with a small reminder.
    </p>
      <b>[Option 3]</b> You are also welcome to do a combination of these choices... writing automated personal messages for some friends and not doing so for others. 
    </p>
